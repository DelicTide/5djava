Project Summary: Building a Tesseract in 4D Space Using Three.js and Vite

Objective: The objective of this project is to create a visual representation of a tesseract (a 4D hypercube) using Three.js for rendering and Vite for development. The ultimate goal is to explore the complexities and possibilities of visualizing 4D objects in a 3D space.

Steps: Initial Setup:

Created a new directory named 4DS. Initialized a new Vite project. Installing Dependencies:

Installed three for 3D rendering. Installed vite as a development server. Creating Basic 3D Scene:

Set up a basic 3D scene using Three.js with a camera, renderer, and animation loop. Adding Tesseract Geometry:

Initially attempted to add a tesseract using BoxGeometry. Realized that we need to use Quaternion rotations for a proper 4D representation. Debugging and Troubleshooting:

Encountered and resolved issues related to Vite's import syntax and updated the development server. Debugged an error related to accessing rotation properties of an undefined object. Incorporating Quaternion Rotations:

Used Quaternion rotations to properly represent the tesseract in 4D. User Interface:

Added OrbitControls for better user interaction with the scene. Physics Consideration:

Discussed the potential for adding a physics engine for simulating 4D physical laws. Challenges: Syntax Errors: Encountered some syntax errors due to Vite's import statements.

Rendering Issues: Initially had difficulties in rendering the tesseract correctly.

Physics Complexity: The complexity of simulating physics in 4D space.

Next Steps: Physics Integration: We plan to integrate physics into the project, potentially using a physics engine like Cannon.js or Ammo.js.

Optimization: We will look into optimizing the code for better performance.

Further Visualization: Planning to add more visual elements to make the physics more understandable.

Documentation: Will add further documentation to explain the code and the physics behind it.
