# Project Summary: Building a Tesseract in 4D Space Using Three.js and Vite

## Introduction
This project aims to create a visual representation of a tesseract (a 4D hypercube) using Three.js for rendering and Vite for development. The endeavor seeks to explore the complexities and possibilities of visualizing 4D objects in a 3D space.

## Visual Aids
Coming soon.

## Technological Stack
- Rendering: Three.js
- Development: Vite
- Physics Engine: Potential integration of Cannon.js or Ammo.js

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup (use a conda/pyenv/dockerenv/codespace)
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`

### Installing Dependencies
- Installed Three.js for 3D rendering.
- Installed Vite as a development server.

## Usage
Open the application in a web browser and interact with the 4D tesseract using the available controls.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request.

## Code Documentation
Further documentation to explain the code and the physics behind it will be added soon.

## Performance Metrics
To be determined.
